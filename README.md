# Finalproject_heartbeat_monitoring

## Background
Pulse sensor is an electronic device that is used to measure the heart rate, like the speed of the heartbeat. Monitoring body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure are the basic things that we can do in order to keep us healthy. Heart rate can be monitored in two ways: one way is to check the pulse either at wrist or the other way is to use a pulse sensor.

## General info
In this project, I designed a heart rate monitor system using Arduino and pulse sensor. Heartbeat is measured in beats per minute or bpm, which indicates the number of times the heart is contracting or expanding in a minute. The principle behind the working of the pulse sensor is photoplethysmography. According to this principle, the changes in the volume of blood in an organ is measured by the changes in the intensity of the light passing through that organ. 
	
## Components Required
* Arduino UNO x1
* Connecting wires
* Pulse sensor module x1
* Breadboard x1
* OLED x1

## Setup
To run this project, install Arduino IDE in the lastest version.

## Possible difficulties
There might be some difficulties when we are building our project. For example, When you testing the heartbeat sensor module, you can see there are some waves on the serial plotter, that is because the principle of the pulse sensor. The pulse sensor essentially a light sensor, this is very important, don't think there are some problems when the serial plotter have some waves. The way to solve that is to cover the sensor with a black obstruction to prevent outside light from entering.
